# Info_PowerShell
Device Information PowerShell Script

This PowerShell script gathers essential information about the device and displays it in a user-friendly format. It retrieves the following details:

    Device Name: The name of the computer.
    Username: The current user's username.
    RAM Memory: The total RAM capacity in gigabytes (GB).
    HDD Information: The size and media type (e.g., SSD, HDD) of each physical disk.

How to Use:

    Open PowerShell with administrator privileges.
    Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
    Run the script using the command: .\InfoScript.ps1

Note:

    If you encounter permission issues, you might need to change the Execution Policy temporarily by running Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned in PowerShell with administrator privileges.

Feel free to customize or contribute to enhance the script's functionality!

Make sure to replace "InfoScript.ps1" with the actual name of your PowerShell script. You can use this description as a README.md file on your GitHub repository. If you need any further modifications or have additional questions, feel free to ask!
